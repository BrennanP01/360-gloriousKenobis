GOALS
=====
Originally, we planned on adding instagram and facebook as some of the platforms. As we learned more about how these APIs work, we learned that they require alot of authentication with facebook to implement, so we changed course to include youtube instead. Twitter was planned from the beginning, and was successfuly implemented. While we were initially considering adding a web based front-end, we decided to use Go instead to better show off different aspects of what we learned in class.
